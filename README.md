Recipes assignment for TOP (The Odin Project)

I am attempting to demonstrate basic knowledge of html by making a recipe book. 

Things I aim to learn through this project:  
    1. html text  
    2. html links/images  
    3. html folder management  
    4. html webpage structure  

Phase 2  

I added css styling to the bare-bones html. Through this I learned about  
    1. basic css styling (colors, font, etc)
    2. css cascade
    3. css chaining
