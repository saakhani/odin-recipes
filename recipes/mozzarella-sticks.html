    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Mozzarella sticks are very easy to make at home. They're deep-fried until golden 
        and crispy on the outside, with melted gooey cheese on the inside. They're so good 
        and take just minutes to fry! Try dipping them in a marinara sauce!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>⅓ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package mozzarella cheese sticks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>
            Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl. 
            Mix bread crumbs and garlic salt together in a medium bowl. 
            Blend flour and cornstarch together in a third bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a large, heavy saucepan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. 
            Dip into egg mixture. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. 
            Press into bread crumbs to coat. Place breaded mozzarella stick on a 
            plate or wire rack. Repeat with remaining mozzarella sticks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a spider spoon or a pair of tongs to lower 3 to 4 mozzarella sticks 
            into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove from 
            heat and drain on paper towels. Repeat to fry remaining mozzarella sticks.
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
