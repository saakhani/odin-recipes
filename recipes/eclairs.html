    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These eclairs are always a hit! My family loves these eclairs and requests them 
        all the time. I usually make them as dessert whenever we have company coming.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet; 
            set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make choux pastry: Combine water and butter in a medium pot. Bring to a boil, 
            stirring until butter melts completely. Reduce heat to low; add flour and salt. 
            Stir vigorously until mixture leaves the sides of the pan and begins to form a 
            stiff ball. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition until incorporated. 
            Using a spoon or pastry bag fitted with a No. 10 or larger tip, spoon or pipe 
            dough onto the prepared cookie sheet in 1 1/2x4-inch strips.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F 
            (165 degrees C) and continue baking until the bottoms sound hollow when 
            lightly tapped, about 20 more minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make filling: Combine milk and pudding mix in a medium bowl according to package 
            directions. Beat heavy cream with an electric mixer in a separate medium bowl 
            until soft peaks form. Beat in confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Fold whipped 
            cream into pudding.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut tops off of cooled pastry shells with a sharp knife. Fill shells with 
            pudding mixture and replace tops.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make icing: Melt chocolate and butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. 
            Stir in confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Stir in hot water, 1 tablespoon at a 
            time, until icing is smooth and has reached desired consistency. Remove from 
            heat and cool slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drizzle chocolate icing over filled eclairs. Store in the refrigerator until serving.
